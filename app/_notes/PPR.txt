As of Next.js 14, PPR is highly experimental and should not be used in production.

PPR needs to be turned on in config file

By default, as much as possible of any route will be statically rendered, creating a static shell

Dynamic parts (components) should be placed inside Suspense boundaries

There are no new APIs to learn

These boundaries tell Next.js that anything within the boundary is dynamic

The boundary prevents the dynamic part (e.g. reading a header or making a non-cached fetch
request) from spreading onto the entire route.

We provide a static fallback to be shown while the dynamic part is rendering

Dynamic components or sub-trees are inserted into the static shell as they become available
